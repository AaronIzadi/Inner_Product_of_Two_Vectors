# Computer Architecture Course Midterm

## Description of the question:

A code in assembly language to compute the ineer product of two vectors.

## Description of the code:

1. First of all, this code asks for n (the length of the two vectors).
2. Secondly, asks for the elements of the first vector and stores them as an array.
3. Third, same as step 2 but for the second vector.
4. Fourth, computes the inner product using "dotproduct" method and prints out the answer.
